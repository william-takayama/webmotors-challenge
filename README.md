# Webmotors Challenge

## :triangular_flag_on_post: What is it? 
  Create a responsive single page application using React (library), consuming webservices (GET) that were available on a specific link and filtering data with multiple and dependable filters. It was developed using React Hooks to create components, SCSS on styles, API services using Fetch method, svg icons for icons. Libraries such as ReactMaterial, Bootstrap, jQuery or Materilize were forbidden to be used. So it's pure coding!
